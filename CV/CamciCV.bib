	abstract = {
	Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum (OAVS) is a complex condition with wide phenotypic variability and presumed etiologic heterogeneity; it is thought to affect ~1:5,600 live births. Characteristic features include hypoplasia of the external ear (i.e. microtia) and mandible, particularly around the temporomandibular region. Additional anomalies frequently seen in patients include maxillary hypoplasia (often proportional to that of the mandible) pre-auricular or lateral facial tags, ear canal atresia with associated hearing deficits, microphthalmia, and cervical vertebral anomalies. One major hypothesis proposes that a defect in vascular development or integrity may induce the facial asymmetry characteristic to OAVS.\\The mouse strain \textit{sbse} replicates much of the OAVS phenotype, particularly the facial asymmetry, microtia, hearing defects, and vertebral malformations. Using low-pass whole genome sequencing we successfully identified a small rearrangement that separates the promoter and first of four untranslated exons from the coding region of the 	extit{Plag1} gene, which encodes a transcription factor. \\ The 	extit{Plag1} gene was first identified as a frequent target of chromosomal translocations found in a variety of tumor types but most prominently salivary/parotid gland adenomas. Of the known downstream targets of 	extit{Plag1}, a number are associated with vascular development. We hypothesize that loss of normal expression of 	extit{Plag1} alters the normal expression of these targets in the branchial arches, affecting craniofacial vessel development and ultimately leading to facial asymmetry. Consistent with this, we demonstrate reduced craniofacial 	extit{Plag1} expression in \textit{sbse} mutant embryos concomitant reduction in expression of vasculature-associated genes.},

	abstract = {Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum (OAVS) is a complex condition that affects ~1:5,600 live births. OAVS is noted for its wide phenotypic variability and often asymmetric presentation. Classic features include hypoplasia of the external ear (i.e. microtia) and mandible, particularly around the temporomandibular region. Other frequently reported anomalies include maxillary hypoplasia that is often proportional to that of the mandible, pre-auricular or lateral facial tags, ear canal atresia with associated hearing deficits, and cervical vertebral anomalies. A number of hypotheses have been put forth to explain the marked facial asymmetry, including that of a vascular disruption event during early facial development (Poswillo, 1975). Despite this, there remains little evidence and few genes have been definitively implicated. Here we report a new mutant mouse line that replicates almost all of the classic OAVS phenotype. Using low-pass whole genome sequencing we successfully identified a small rearrangement within the mapping interval that disrupted only a single gene. Significantly, the candidate gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in appropriate embryonic tissues including the branchial arches that give rise to many of the features seen in patients with OAVS. Among the known downstream targets of this factor are two genes with prominent roles in vascular development and integrity, potentially providing the first genetic mechanism in support of Poswillo’s original hypothesis. This mutant mouse line provides a rare opportunity to identify the critical genetic pathways involved in this unique phenotypic presentation and thus an array of candidates for causing OAVS in patients.},
